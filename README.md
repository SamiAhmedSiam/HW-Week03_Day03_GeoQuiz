# GeoQuiz Project
The assignment will add a further condition to the GeoQuiz Project that we applied together in the lab today.
Thus, the starting point will be from the last thing that we did in GeoQuiz Project.
> Note: If you miss some piece of code through following the lab,
 you can find the last version of GeoQuiz Project in this assignment.

## Part One - Background Image
---
- Make the background of the screen to be an image instead of the background white, use any image you like.

## Part Two - Preventing Repeat Answers and Graded Quiz (Optional)
---
- Once a user provides an answer for a particular question, disable the buttons for that question to prevent multiple answers being entered.
- After the user provides answers for all of the quiz questions, display a `Toast` with a percentage score for the quiz.
